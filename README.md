NAME
====

IRC::Log::Textual - interface to IRC logs from Textual

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use IRC::Log::Textual;

my $log = IRC::Log::Textual.new($filename.IO);

say "Logs from $log.date()";
.say for $log.entries.List;

my $log = IRC::Log::Textual.new($text, $date);
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

IRC::Log::Textual provides an interface to the IRC logs that are generated by the Textual application on MacOS. Please see [IRC::Log](IRC::Log) for more information.

Since Textual stores its daily file in the local time zone, specifying a path with `.new` will **also** read the files in the same directory that are one day before it and one day after it to make sure all entries of the date in UTC are captured.
