[2021-04-23T00:20:24+0200] <Xliff> Still wondering if it might be a nice idea to load up Raku bytecode in a database and have an app server execute the stored data rather than what's on disk.

[2021-04-23T12:13:18+0200] <PimDaniel> lizmat: I suppose  the Schwartzian Transform reduces the sort function to the shortest equivalent?
[2021-04-23T12:15:45+0200] <lizmat> it makes the comparisons cheaper by doing the extraction of the value only once for each value, instead of two times for each comparison

[2021-04-23T14:30:25+0200] <andinus> i havent reported this yet. its on openbsd, i have both git and tar in $PATH

[2021-04-23T15:26:20+0200] <masak> public namespace hierarchies are ultimately futile and inconsistent -- but maybe still a net good...?

[2021-04-23T15:28:49+0200] <masak> logs picked it up OK, though
[2021-04-23T15:29:32+0200] <masak> El_Che: I was always fascinated by the Newspeak language's stance: "there is no global namespace, because global namespaces don't make sense"

[2021-04-23T15:30:31+0200] <moritz> with a global numberspace? :-)
[2021-04-23T15:30:46+0200] <masak> Joe Armstrong had this idea that if you normalized and hashed your code, you wouldn't need to name it at all. he never got around to realizing that idea, though

[2021-04-23T15:32:56+0200] <moritz> you can also have local spaces, then you just need routing that depends on the local enviornment
[2021-04-23T15:33:23+0200] <moritz> just like email in the early days, where (allegedly) you'd have to tell the servers the next hop, or maybe even all of them, to deliver that mail
[2021-04-23T15:33:56+0200] <masak> I'd prefer it if spammers had to do it that way

[2021-04-23T15:36:33+0200] <El_Che> and we may buy stuff once in a while if they go that extra mile :)
[2021-04-23T15:38:24+0200] <masak> moritz: in the past week or so, I've been trying to imagine designing Sokoban, but with all the interacting sprites in the game (player character, walls, floor tiles, boxes) being Hewitt actors or CSP processes
[2021-04-23T15:42:29+0200] <masak> seems like a non sequitur perhaps, but I was reminded of that when you said "local sapces" and routing based on the local environment :)

[2021-04-23T15:45:46+0200] <masak> I'm aware of Waluigi :)
[2021-04-23T15:48:52+0200] <masak> Juerd: if you got to redesign the CPAN namespace hierarchy from scratch -- like, wave a magic wand and make everything in a certain way, including all the legacy and inconsistent stuff -- what would you do?
[2021-04-23T15:49:52+0200] <moritz> I know the question wasn't direct at me, but the first thing I'd do is to get rid of the mismatch between LWP:: and libwww-
[2021-04-23T15:50:27+0200] <moritz> and maybe call it something starting with HTTP::Client
[2021-04-23T15:52:07+0200] <masak> provocative/radical question: does it need names at all? (I guess, in the spirit of Joe Armstrong)
[2021-04-23T15:52:39+0200] <masak> what if there was a good enough search engine, that took you to the right module, based on its description or something. not its name.
[2021-04-23T15:52:40+0200] <lizmat> .oO( who needs names if you have numbers )
[2021-04-23T15:52:46+0200] <lizmat> 404 for the win!
[2021-04-23T15:52:57+0200] <masak> yes, like that, but in all seriousness
[2021-04-23T15:53:06+0200] <masak> are the names necessary?
[2021-04-23T15:53:18+0200] <masak> maybe they are more of a social thing...?
[2021-04-23T15:53:22+0200] <lizmat> well, suppose wines would work that way
[2021-04-23T15:53:32+0200] <lizmat> .... savouring a nice 4573562 right now!
[2021-04-23T15:53:41+0200] <masak> I don't see why not
[2021-04-23T15:53:50+0200] <masak> except less sentimental, perhaps
[2021-04-23T15:54:02+0200] <masak> lizmat: clearly you don't love numbers as much as I do :D
[2021-04-23T15:54:55+0200] <masak> I guess I can see the social/sentimental use of names
[2021-04-23T15:55:13+0200] <masak> like, the name "Dancer" turns into kind of a meme or nodal point for people's interest
[2021-04-23T15:55:17+0200] <lizmat> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner    # I'm a not a number!
[2021-04-23T15:55:46+0200] <masak> lizmat: I actually watched the 60s series. weird, occasionally good.
[2021-04-23T15:56:23+0200] <lizmat> yeah, too bad the ending was meh because the funding had dried up
[2021-04-23T15:56:28+0200] <masak> lizmat: I groaned when he crashed the 60s supercomputer by inputing the question "why?"...
[2021-04-23T15:56:30+0200] â¢ moritz: writes down "lizmat is NaN"
[2021-04-23T15:56:40+0200] <masak> lizmat: what do you mean, the ending was awesome :P
[2021-04-23T15:56:43+0200] <lizmat> but which NaN  ?
[2021-04-23T15:57:34+0200] â¢ masak: .oO( and once you identify which one, how will you know? )
[2021-04-23T15:57:44+0200] <tadzik> . o O ( do you want some bread? Yes, NaN bread please ) )
[2021-04-23T15:57:54+0200] <lizmat> the ending was hacked together really, it was never intended to end at 17 episodes
[2021-04-23T15:57:59+0200] <masak> tadzik! \o/
[2021-04-23T15:58:04+0200] <moritz> the bread one

[2021-04-23T15:58:33+0200] <masak> we have to stop meeting like this.
[2021-04-23T15:58:41+0200] <moritz> #perl6 reunion day? :D
[2021-04-23T15:58:43+0200] <masak> or maybe meet like this more often
[2021-04-23T15:59:04+0200] <tadzik> hm, I barely greet people because I always assume that we're just always there, even if we don't talk a lot :P
[2021-04-23T15:59:05+0200] <sjn> moritz: looks like a #perl6 reunion day, yes :)
[2021-04-23T15:59:18+0200] <masak> tadzik: actor-based sokoban, what do you think?
[2021-04-23T15:59:38+0200] <tadzik> masak: only if it's tracking your eyes and the stones move by themselves when you're not looking

[2021-04-23T16:00:01+0200] <masak> tadzik: "boxes" :)
[2021-04-23T16:00:14+0200] <tadzik> though there might be a geneva convention that forbids this
[2021-04-23T16:00:23+0200] <tadzik> masak: I was thinking outside of the boxes :P
[2021-04-23T16:00:39+0200] <masak> nowadays, if something is tracking your eyes, it would be to train a neural net for something
[2021-04-23T16:00:57+0200] <masak> tadzik: ah, you iconoclast
[2021-04-23T16:01:05+0200] <tadzik> I'd welcome someone reclaiming it and turning it into something fun rather than exploitative
[2021-04-23T16:01:27+0200] <masak> wait, sokoban is exploitative?
[2021-04-23T16:01:45+0200] â¢ masak: .oO( won't someone think of the poor warehouse managers? )
[2021-04-23T16:01:50+0200] <moritz> eye-tracking sokoban could be :D
[2021-04-23T16:02:08+0200] â¢ masak: .oO( sokoban as a metaphor for working at an amazon warehouse )
[2021-04-23T16:02:20+0200] <moritz> combined with micro transactions to make it more bearable

[2021-04-23T16:05:07+0200] <masak> it's like when someone types out \infty
[2021-04-23T16:05:17+0200] <masak> it kind of looks like a lazy eight to me, don't know how
[2021-04-23T16:06:03+0200] <tadzik> masak: here, take this: (â¯Â°â¡Â°ï¼â¯ï¸µ â»ââ»
